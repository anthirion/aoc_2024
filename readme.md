# Advent of code 2024

## Presentation

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

Each folder corresponds to a specific day (`day1/`, `day2/`, etc.), and contains:

- `main.py`: my main solution script
- `part1.py`: functions used to solve part1 problem
- `part2.py`: functions used to solve part2 problem
- `puzzle.txt`: the puzzle input for the day
- Additional helper files or modules when needed

##Â Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills through daily challenges
- Practice clean and efficient Python code
- Explore optimization techniques (PyPy, Cython, mypyc, etc.)

## How to run

Make sure you're using **Python 3.10+**, then run a specific day's solution with:

```bash
python dayX/main.py --part=1
python dayX/main.py --part=2
```
